With the 2018 build season nearing, the programming team looks ahead to the future. 

Here are a few of our goals for the 2018 season:
  * Educate all of our rookie members in the ways of Java and Python, as well as general programming concepts.
  * Fine tune our autonomous code. 
  * Strengthen our vision processing program, [punkvision](https://github.com/lnstempunks/punkvision).
  * Create distributable images and instructions so that other FRC teams can use our programs and techniques to accelerate their vision processing.
  * Collaborate with other robotics teams to create a neural network for our vision processing
We have been diligently learning to use the excellent [Python 3 port](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io) of the FRC Robot coding platform.

In other news, we have won our first competition as a team ever, the Tennessee Robo Rodeo! We are so greatful to our fellow alliance members: [Team 2393, the Robotichauns](http://www.knoxvillecatholic.com/parents-students/robotics-team/) and [Team 4630, the RoboDragons](http://chsrobodragons.com/)!
