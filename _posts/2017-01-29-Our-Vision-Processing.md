For our vision processing this year, we are using a Raspberry PI model 3B, running raspbian.

## Getting Started

[https://github.com/LN-STEMpunks/WOPR-JR-Vision](https://github.com/LN-STEMpunks/WOPR-JR-Vision)

All you need is a raspberry pi (any model) with any debian-based OS (and possibly redhat/fedora see install.sh) and then clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/LN-STEMpunks/WOPR-JR-Vision`

Go into that directory:

`cd WOPR-JR-Vision`

Now, install the needed packages:

`./install.sh`

You should be ready to go!

For our default config, run:

`python src/grip.py --show`
